=======

Blood Gold and Sorcery is a graphical roguelike, like Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup or Doom the Roguelike.

But, what is a roguelike ?
--------------------------

Definitions are boring, so here's one from Wikipedia:
`The roguelike is a sub-genre of role-playing video games, characterized by level randomization and permanent death.`
The most famous of all may be Rogue, DCSS or Diablo (yes that's a roguelike !).

Development
-----------

BGS is a C++ game using SFML 2.0 ([http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)) and BOOST library.

Compiling
---------
ToDo : make a compiling tutorial.
Hint: use Cmake.
